## About The Project
DoubleYou (W) is a winning project for the 2025 HUJI (Hebrew University) Hackathon! The core idea is an LLM that has context for all your data. The mobile app lets you select your backend host and talk to the LLM, request summaries and even sends data such as Health, Location, Contacts and Calendar to be stored in the backend.

The entire project is open-source and meant to be self-hosted, ensuring your data never leaves your control.

## Results
DoubleYou won the 2025 HUJI Hackathon and received lots of compliments from different judges, industry employees (from Intel, Mobileye, and Lightricks - the sponsors of the event), and even faculty members. We participated in the Master's Degree & Alumni category.

## The Team
Our team consisted of 6 Computer Science students. Three of us were master's students, two were bachelor's students, and one was an alumnus.
